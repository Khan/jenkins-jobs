# 1) build index and chunk files

#    Storage bucket at ka_translations
# 3) build js and css files (and other files that we serve from GCS)
# 4) Upload these static files to a Google Cloud Storage bucket at ka-static.
# 5) change the Setting `translations_version`, which controls which set of
#    translations the webapp will load from Google Cloud Storage
# 6) change the Setting `js_css_md5sum`, which controls the set of js/css
#    files that webapp will serve from Google Cloud Storage
