Send notifications to slack, email, or asana when a job is done.

The intent is you wrap your *entire* job inside a `notify()` call.
Well, almost the entire job: this must run inside a `node()`, e.g.
`onMaster()` or `onWorker()`.  But other than that it should wrap
the entire job.  Then when the body is done executing, looks at
the build status (or exception-handling) and sends notifications
as appropriate.

The argument is a map that has `slack`, `email`, and 'asana' as
possible keys. Each value is itself a map with options for that
notification mode. For instance `slack` has an option what channel to
talk to, etc. See the code for what options are supported.

If you set the envvar `env.SENT_TO_SLACK` in the body, then we will
suppress any sending to slack, under the assumption the body did all
appropriate sending.  This is useful for test jobs, when if they fail
due to test-failures we want to send a customized slack message.  (But
if they fail for some other reason such as a timeout, we still want to
send to slack from here!)
