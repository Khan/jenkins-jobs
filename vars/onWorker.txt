Same as `node(<label>)` but does a bunch of executor-specific setup too.

1. It makes sure jenkins-jobs is available in the current workspace
   (almost every node needs jenkins-jobs to do further checkouts).
2. It enables virtualenv (for python scripts)
3. It enables access to secrets.py [optional]
4. It turns on timestamping of all commands run on that node.
5. It runs all of this in workspace shared across jobs.
