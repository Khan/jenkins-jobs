Same as `node(<label>)` but does a bunch of executor-specific setup too.

1. It makes sure jenkins-jobs is available in the current workspace
   (almost every node needs jenkins-jobs to do further checkouts).
2. It enables virtualenv (for python scripts)
3. It turns on timestamping of all commands run on that node.
4. It runs all of this in workspace shared across jobs.

If the entire job runs on a worker, you should wrap this around a `notify()`
call, and put the rest of your job inside.  If only some of the job runs on a
worker, you can use this elsewhere instead.  See also `onMaster()`, if you
don't want to use workers.
