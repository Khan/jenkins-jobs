Decrypts secrets.py in the webapp-root.

It must be called while the current directory is the workspace-root.

NOTE(benkraft): withSecrets is leaky; other branches of the same job will see
the secrets file too, even if they are not in a withSecrets block.

We also provide the ability to just decrypt one secret: the slack
secret that alertlib needs to talk to slack.  It is a surprisingly
common case that that is the only secret we need for a given use.
