Same as `node("master")` but does a bunch of executor-specific setup too.

1. It makes sure jenkins-jobs is available in the current workspace
   (almost every node needs jenkins-jobs to do further checkouts).
2. It enables virtualenv (for python scripts)
3. It enables access to secrets.py [optional]
4. It turns on timestamping of all commands run on that node.

This is normally run by `notify()`, and does not need to be called by
individual job-scripts.  However, if your job-script calls
`notify.runWithNotification()` instead of the normal `notify()`, it
will need to call `onMaster` whenever it needs to allocate an executor
node.
