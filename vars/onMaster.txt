Same as `node("master")` but does a bunch of executor-specific setup too.

1. It makes sure jenkins-jobs is available in the current workspace
   (almost every node needs jenkins-jobs to do further checkouts).
2. It enables virtualenv (for python scripts)
3. It enables access to secrets.py [optional]
4. It turns on timestamping of all commands run on that node.

This should normally be wrapped around `notify()`, which will wrap the
actual job logic.  See also `onWorker()`, if you don't want to run on master.
