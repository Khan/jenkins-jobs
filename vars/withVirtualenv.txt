This pipeline step runs its body in a python2 virtualenv.

This means that every python command run inside it will use the
virtualenv rather than the system python/etc.

It is not typically used manually -- onMaster/etc use it automatically
as needed.

There is also a python3() function which sets up a virtualenv to run
python3 scripts.  This is webapp-specific, and uses the virtualenv in
webapp's deploy/Makefile.  This typically *is* used manually, when
making calls to the deploy and test scripts that use the top-level
python3 virtualenv in webapp.

Note it is possible to have both the python2 and python3 virtualenvs
active at the same time!  In that world, running a binary under
`python2` will use the python2 virtualenv, and `python3` will use the
python3 virtualenv.  They will fight over the `python` binary, so
don't use that.  (We are careful that all our webapp scripts
explicitly say `python2` or `python3` for that reason.)
