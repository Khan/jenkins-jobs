This pipeline step runs its body in the "deploy" python3 virtualenv.

This means that every python command run inside it will use the
virtualenv rather than the system python/etc.

This is only needed for our deploy scripts, which include third-party
deps that are only installed in the virtualenv.

This is webapp-specific, and uses the virtualenv in webapp's
deploy/Makefile -- so you must call this only *after* making sure
webapp is cloned!
